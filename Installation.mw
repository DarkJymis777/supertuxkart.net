There are several ways SuperTuxKart can be installed. The easiest solution is to use a binary (which are supplied for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux), but it is not complicated to build STK yourself from either the latest stable sources or from the cutting edge SVN.
= Binaries =

== Windows (XP and above) ==
Download the latest binary from our [[Downloads|Download]] page. It comes with an installer. It is recommended not to install a current version of SuperTuxKart on top of an existing installation. Newer versions (at least 0.8 and later) will prompt to uninstall a previously installed version if this situation is detected.

== Linux ==
For Linux you can see if an up-to-date package is available for your distribution:
* Debian-based (Ubuntu, Mint, ...): <tt>sudo apt-get install supertuxkart</tt>
* Fedora:  <tt>yum install supertuxkart</tt>
* Gentoo  <tt>emerge supertuxkart</tt>

In case your linux distribution does not have STK in their repositories, you can always [[Downloads|download]] a static binary.

== MacOS x ==
* The MacOS X binary can be found on our [[Downloads|downloads]] page.

= Build from source =

== Getting STK sources ==

Pick either stable or development version. The latter has the latest features and fixes but might also have new bugs.

=== Stable version ===
To compile the stable version, you can download source code tarballs from the SourceForge [http://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/ downloads page].

=== Latest development version ===

SupertTuxKart biw uses git for source code, and SVN for data files. The core code repository is hosted on our [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code github page]. Example clone command:
<code>git clone https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code.git stk-code</code>
It is about 130 MB in size.

Data files are hosted on sourceforge and use SVN. Example checkout command :
<code>svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/supertuxkart/code/stk-assets stk-assets</code>
It is about 650 MB in size (some of the assets from a downloaded supertuxkart tarball could also be reused probably).

These two repositories should be downloaded in the same folder, so that folders "stk-code" and "stk-assets" are next to each other.

== Platform-specific compile instructions ==

After picking stable or SVN version, choose your path depending on your operating system:

* [[Build_STK_on_Linux|Linux]]
* [[Building_and_packaging_on_OSX|Mac OS X]]
* [[How_to_build_the_Windows_version|Windows]]
