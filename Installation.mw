There are several ways SuperTuxKart can be installed. The easiest solution is to use a binary (which are supplied for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux), but it is not complicated to build STK yourself from either the latest stable sources or from the cutting edge SVN.
= Binaries =

=== Windows (Vista and XP) ===
Download the latest binary from our [[Downloads|Download]] page. It comes with an installer. It is recommended not to install a current version of SuperTuxKart on top of an existing installation - though since 0.6 you will only get some warnings, which you can safely ignore.

===Linux===
For GNU/Linux you can see if an up-to-date package is available for your distro - depending on distro try:
* apt-get install supertuxkart
* aptitude install supertuxkart
* or for Fedora:  yum install supertuxkart
* or for Gentoo  emerge supertuxkart
* or for [http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=uhu UHU] get it at http://uhu.linux.hu/
* For SuSE Linux / openSUSE, you can add the games:/action repository and then install supertuxkart using your favourite tool (YaST, rug, zen-installer, zypper, smart). SuperTuxKart is built for SuSE i586 and x86_64. There are 2 known repositories:
**http://ftp-1.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/games:/action/ then browse to your Linux Version.
**http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:/arcade/.

Alternatively, download the binary tarball from the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 STK Download area]
 tar -xjvf supertuxkart_bin_x86_linux.tar.bz2
 cd supertuxkart-0.6
and to run STK:
 run_game.sh

=== MacOS x ===
* The MacOS X binary can be found on our [[Downloads|downloads]] page.

= Build the latest stable version =
Download the source tarball from the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 STK Download area]

 tar -xjvf supertuxkart-0.7-src.tar.bz2
 cd supertuxkart-0.7
 ./configure && make
 sudo make install
and if it's OK, you can run STK:
 supertuxkart

= Build the latest unstable version (from SVN) =
Check out the sources using:
 svn co https://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk
 cd supertuxkart
 ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
 sudo make install
and if it's OK, you can run STK:
 supertuxkart

do a:
