{{Popup-warning|content=This page is work-in-progress and NOT yet approved by the core team. Help is appreciated.}}

Before you contact the team, report a bug, post on the forums, etc. you should read through this page. Following the guidelines and instructions on this page will make the community and project run more efficiently and happily. Though this article may sound a bit harsh, please don't be afraid to post. The team is generally quite patient, unless you're a repeat offender. ;)

== Please keep in mind... ==

It's important to keep a few things in mind whenever contacting the team. First and foremost, '''the developers are not paid.''' The developers do this because they enjoy it, not because you paid them. They're not paid to please you. [http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=6730 Here] is an example of what ''not'' to do.

Also, keep in mind that '''the developers only work on their free time.''' They might not have a chance to answer right away. Be patientâ€”they'll respond eventually. And if they don't, <u>politely</u> bump your post. This also means that you shouldn't make trivial requests that are of no importance, nor extremely demanding requests. Again, [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/issues/2551 here] is an example of what ''not'' to do.

== Guidelines ==

=== When reporting a bug or crash in the game ===

* First, check if it's already reported on [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/issues GitHub]. Be sure to check both "open" and "closed" bugs.
* If the bug is closed, check the reasons for being closed. If it was fixed in a development version of STK, you may want to either wait for the next release or consider building from source (see the [[Community]] page). If it was resolved as invalid, but still is a problem, comment on the issue and see if something can be done.
* If the bug is resolved "duplicate", find the duplicate bug and report any further information there.
* If the bug is open, see if you can report any more information to the team.

If you cannot find the same bug
