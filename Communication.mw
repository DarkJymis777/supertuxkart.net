{{Faq-question|title=The developers only work on their free time.|answer=They might not have a chance to answer right away. Be patientâ€”they'll respond eventually. And if they don't, <u>politely</u> bump your post. This also means that you shouldn't make trivial requests that are of no importance, nor extremely demanding requests.

== Guidelines ==

=== When reporting a bug or crash in the game ===

* If the bug is already reported on [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue GitHub]:
** If the bug is open, see if you can report any more information to the team.
** If the bug is closed, you probably will have to wait for the next release for the fix to be included in the game, unless you want to build from source.
* If the bug is not reported:
** Make the title clear and descriptive.
** Include a detailed explanation of the problem.
** Include system information such as your operating system, operating system version, graphics processor (GPU) model and manufacturer, graphics driver version, and CPU model.
** Include the stdout.log file. (See "Where does STK store the user config file" on the [[FAQ]] page for information about where this file is located.)
** Include screenshots, if needed.
** If you are capable of compiling STK yourself and running it under a debugger (such as GDB, Valgrind, or Visual Studio Debugger), please compile STK in debug mode, run it, and post the output from the debugger.
** Include any other information as you see fit.
