{{Faq-question|title=My AI karts drive off the road!|answer=There could be many reasons for this:

* Your driveline is misplaced.
* Your driveline has a break in it.
* Your road makes too sharp of a turn.
* Your road is too narrow.

Try to correct any of the issues that apply, and see if that helps.

{{Faq-question|title=Transparent or translucent decorations don't appear correctly in-game!|answer=Most likely this is a sorting issue. Try exporting transparent parts as separate objects ("Object" in SuperTuxKart Object Properties panel in Blender). If your transparent section includes part of the main drivable area, be sure the check the "Drivable" box in the SuperTuxKart Object Properties panel. Also, ensure that "Disable writing to Z-buffer" is checked for any transparent or partially transparent textures in the SuperTuxKart Image Properties panel.}}
{{Faq-question|title=Transparent objects display weirdly in Blender!|answer=This is for the same reason discussed in the question above: sorting issues, and is a known issue with Blender. Unfortunately, we can't change this. Try checking the "X-Ray" box under "Display" in the "Object" section of the Blender Properties window for your transparent objects. It's not a golden hammer, but it might help somewhat.}}
{{Faq-question|title=My kart slides around and I can't steer/accelerate properly!|answer=This is most likely a result of normals smoothing. Disable normals smoothing in the SuperTuxKart Scene Properties panel.}}
