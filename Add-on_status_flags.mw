| DFSG-Compliant
| As tuxfamily.org does not require DFSG-compliant licenses, add-ons which do not completely meet the requirements may be found on the add-ons server. Some distributors of SuperTuxKart may prefer to restrict the game to using DFSG-compliant content, so this flag would be useful to them.

| Invalid Textures
| In order to preserve compatibility with some video cards, textures used in add-ons should always have dimensions that are a power of 2. However, if add-on developers choose not to abide by this, then their add-ons will have this flag, and may be unusable on some systems.
