==Introduction==
Scripting is used to provide all kinds of fun in-game interactions. If there's anything special you want to happen based on some event (Kart smashing into another kart, driving over a big red button, hitting a wooden box with an explosive cake), then scripting is just the thing for you!

Details on triggering scripts.


===Action Triggers===
Action Triggers are point based triggers with a radius. Think of it as a big bubble that pops when you enter it, triggering some action. This is probably the best method of triggering location-based events. By default the trigger is disabled right after it is activated. They can be activated or deactivated as you wish, using other scripts.

Relevant Methods:

* createTrigger(name, location, distance) : Create a new trigger at the specified 3D location.
* enableTrigger(name) : Enable a trigger
* disableTrigger(name) : Disable a trigger
