This page describes the format of the kart.xml file, which is used in SuperTuxkart to define some kart options.

== File Format and Location ==
The kart.xml file is a simple xml file wich have to exists in each kart folder

 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <!-- Generated with script from SVN rev 9075 -->
 <kart name              = "Beagle"
       version           = "2"
       model-file        = "beagle.b3d"
       icon-file         = "beagle_icon.png"
       minimap-icon-file = "beagle_icon.png"
       shadow-file       = "beagle_shadow.png"
       groups            = "standard"
       rgb               = "0.7 0 0" 
       random-wheel-rot  = "true"
       shadow-scale      = "1.0"
       shadow-x-offset      = "0.0"
       shadow-y-offset      = "0.0">
   <sounds engine = "large"/>
   <animations left = "0"
               straight = "20"
               right = "40"
               start-winning = "50"
               start-winning-loop = "60"
               end-winning = "70"
               start-losing = "80"
               start-losing-loop = "90"
               end-losing = "100"/>
   <wheels>
     <rear-right position = "0.392944 0.184659 -0.353249"
                  model    = "wheel-rear-right.b3d"       />
     <front-left position = "-0.394121 0.184659 0.435626"
                  model    = "wheel-front-left.b3d"       />
     <rear-left position = "-0.394121 0.184659 -0.353249"
                  model    = "wheel-rear-left.b3d"       />
     <front-right position = "0.392944 0.184659 0.435626"
                  model    = "wheel-front-right.b3d"       />
   </wheels>
 </kart>

This shows the kart.xml file of Beagle.

Note: Actually, you don't have to create this file yourself. The Blender's [http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/New_kart_tutorial#Exporting_karts kart exporter] do it for you!

== Attributes ==
The following attributes can be used.

*''name'': The name of the kart which will appear in the menus (example: "Beagle").
[[File:Kart_xml_name.png]]
*''version'': The version number of the kart (example: "1").
*''type'': The type of kart which will determine to which properties group the kart belongs (light, medium or heavy).
*''model-file'': The file name which contain the model of the kart (example: "beagle.b3d").
*''icon-file'': The icon file (128x128) used in some menus (example: "beagle_icon.png").
[[File:Kart_xml_icon_file.png]]
*''minimap-icon-file'': The icon file used in the minimap during races (example: "beagle_icon.png").
[[File:Kart_xml_minimap-icon-file.png]]
*''shadow-file'': The shadow image file used under the kart (example: "beagle_shadow.png"). See the [[Kart shadow tutorial]] for more informations.
*''groups'': The group (tab) in which the kart will appear in the kart selection menu (example: "standard").
[[File:Kart_xml_group.png]]
*''rgb'': If the kart don't have a valid "minimap-icon-file", a RGB colored dot will be shown on the minimap (example: "0.7 0 0"). Not really used anymore.
*''random-wheel-rot'': This boolean value put the wheels in a random rotation at each race start. This can be useful avoiding to see a repetition in a strong texture of wheels in the same rotation (example: "true").
*''shadow-scale'': As the shadow image can be difficult to set correctly for the kart, this value scale it (example: "1.0").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_scale.png]]
*''shadow-x-offset'': Offset the shadow image in the X value. Positive value slide the shadow to the right (example: "0.12").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_xOffset.png]]
*''shadow-y-offset'': Offset the shadow image in the Y value. Positive value slide the shadow to the top of the kart (example: "0.35").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_yOffset.png]]
*''sounds''
**''engine'': The kind of engine sound the kart make: "large" or "small" ("small" by default).

*''animations''
Here are the frame numbers, in the "model-file", of each animation:
 left <-- straight --> right // The animation between directions
 // Frame range between "right" and "start-winning" is not used
 start-winning -> start-winning-loop -> end-winning // First the "start-winning" animation is played then "start-winning-loop" is played in loop and "end-winning" is finally played.
 // It's the same for "losing".
[[File:Kart_xml_animation_plan.png]]
Note: "-loop" version are not necessary.

*''wheels''
**''rear-right'', ''front-left'', ''rear-left'', ''front-right''
***''position'': The position, in the "model-file" space of each wheels (example: "0.392944 0.184659 -0.353249").
***''model'': The model file of the current wheel (example: "wheel-rear-right.b3d").

== Tweaking Physics Parameter ==
Additional section can be added to the kart.xml files in which kart-specific physics and gameplay parameters can be specified. All sections from the STK config file data/stk_config.xml which are in the <general-kart-defaults> tags can be just copied into the kart.xml file and modified. This way you can make a kart heavier, make it easier to use slip stream etc. A simple example:
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <!-- Generated with script from SVN rev 0.1 -->
 <kart name              = "Mozilla"
       version           = "2"
       model-file        = "mozilla.b3d"
       icon-file         = "mozillaicon.png"
       minimap-icon-file = "mozillaicon.png"
       shadow-file       = "mozillashadow.png"
       groups            = "standard"
       rgb               = "0.7 0 0" >
 ...
     <!-- mass  -->
     <mass value="300"/>
     <nitro consumption="2" max-speed-increase="3"/>
 ...
 </kart>
This makes the mozilla kart heavier (default 225), and it will use up nitro quicker, and get less benefit from it. The stk_config.xml file is well documented, so feel free to tweak the kart. Note that it is our intention to have kart-specific physics after the 0.8 release (see [[Milestones]]). If you do any tweaking of the physics parameters before 0.8 it might be necessary to redo this work after 0.8 (but hopefully it won't be that much work).
