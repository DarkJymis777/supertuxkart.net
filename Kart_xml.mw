This page describes the format of the kart.xml file, which is used in SuperTuxkart to define some kart options.

== File Format and Location ==
The kart.xml file is a simple xml file wich have to exists in each kart folder

 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <!-- Generated with script from SVN rev 9075 -->

This shows the kart.xml file of Beagle.

Note: Actually, you don't have to create this file yourself. The blender kart exporter do it for you!

== Attributes ==
The following attributes can be used (defaults in bold)

*''name'': The name of the kart wich will appear in the menus (example: "Beagle").
[[File:Kart_xml_name.png]]
*''version'': The version number of the kart (example: "1").
*''model-file'': The file name wich contain the model of the kart (example: "beagle.b3d").
*''icon-file'': The icon file (128x128) used in some menus (example: "beagle_icon.png").
[[File:Kart_xml_icon_file.png]]
*''minimap-icon-file'': The icon file used in the minimap during races (example: "beagle_icon.png").
[[File:Kart_xml_minimap-icon-file.png]]
*''shadow-file'': The shadow image file used under the kart (example: "beagle_shadow.png"). See the [[Kart shadow tutorial]] for more informations on this.
*''groups'': The group (tab) in wich the kart will appear in the karting selection menu (example: "standard").
[[File:Kart_xml_group.png]]
*''rgb'': If the kart don't have a valid "minimap-icon-file", a RGB colored dot will be shown on the minimap (example: "0.7 0 0"). Not really used anymore.
*''random-wheel-rot'': This boolean value put the wheels in a random rotation at each race start. This can be useful to avoid to see a repetition in a strong texture of wheels in the same rotation (example: "true").
*''shadow-scale'': As the shadow image can be difficult to set correctly for the kart, this value scale it (example: "1.0").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_scale.png]]
*''shadow-x-offset'': Offset the shadow image in the X value. Positive value slide the shadow to the right (example: "0.12").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_xOffset.png]]
*''shadow-y-offset'': Offset the shadow image in the Y value. Positive value slide the shadow to the top of the kart (example: "0.35").
[[File:Kart_xml_shadow_yOffset.png]]
*''sounds''
**''engine'': The kind of engine sound the kart make: "large" or "small" ("small" by default).

*''animations''
Here are the frame numbers, in the "model-file", of each animation:
 left <-- straight --> right // The animation between directions
 // Frame range between "right" and "start-winning" is not used
 start-winning -> start-winning-loop -> end-winning // First the "start-winning" animation is played then "start-winning-loop" is played in loop and "end-winning" is finally played.
 // It's the same for "losing".
[[File:Kart_xml_animation_plan.png]]
Note: "-loop" version are not necessary.

*''wheels''
**''rear-right'', ''front-left'', ''rear-left'', ''front-right''
***position: The position, in the "model-file" space of each wheels (example: "0.392944 0.184659 -0.353249").
***model the model file of the current wheel (example: "wheel-rear-right.b3d").
