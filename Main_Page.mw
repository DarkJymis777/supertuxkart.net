We have also updated our donation package: the previously included track Carnaval Del Cacao is now released under CC-BY 3.0 and available from our addons server. The new package includes an updated version of Antediluvian Abyss and a new track Candela City, which we expect to be included in the 0.9.2 release. If you want to support SuperTuxKart, go to http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/donate.php. If you have previously donated US$5 or more, please contact us, and we will make the new package available to you for free.

==We have a new Website==

We just made public our new website. The old website was a bit outdated and not mobile friendly.

We commissioned Jean-Manuel Clémençon our lead artist to create a fresh design while retaining the feel and look of our beloved old one.

It has been a rather long time since our last official release - nearly one and a half year. But we have not been idle during this, actually more the opposite. The 0.9 release contains some significant changes - especially (though not only) visual changes.
