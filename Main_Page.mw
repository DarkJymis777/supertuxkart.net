We have also updated our donation package: The previously included track Carnaval del Cacao is now released under CC-BY 3.0 and is available from our addons server. The new package includes an updated version of Antediluvian Abyss, as well a new track called Candela City, which we expect to be included in the 0.9.2 release. If you want to support SuperTuxKart, head over to the [http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/donate.php donation page.] If you have previously donated US$5 or more, please contact us, and we will make the new package available to you for free.

==We have a new website!==
</div>
We have just released our brand new website! The old site had been with us for a while, so it became quite outdated, and lacked modern conveniences such as mobile support.

We commissioned Jean-Manuel Clémençon, our lead artist, to create a fresh design while retaining the feel and look of our beloved old one.

It has been a rather long time since our last official release - nearly one and a half year. But we have not been idle during this, actually more the opposite. The 0.9 release contains some significant changes - especially (though not only) visual changes.
