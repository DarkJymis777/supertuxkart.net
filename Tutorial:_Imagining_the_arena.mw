Welcome in the '''part 3''' of this tutorial designed to help you to do racing tracks for SuperTuxKart.

If you haven't read yet the [[Tutorial: Planning| part 2]] it's recommended to do it before reading this one.

The goal is
*Imagining the arena
*Creating an architectural concept for the stadium
*Imagining the playground

== Composition of a map ==

Now before jumping into work It's important to clarify a few point. Let's break down what constitute a map. I will take for example the Gran Paradiso Island to explain different area in maps. Remember even if it's a track and we are building an arena both are very similar. There is roughly 3 area in a map.

=== The playground area ===

The green zone is called the playground area. It's the area where the player can drive during a normal race or a normal battle. It's the only part where the player can go (without cheating and or enabling artist debug mode)
*The area is highly detailed
*It's the only area where the player can go
*There can be secret area. But if it's intended to be able to be discovered by the player then it's the playground area

==The Surrounding area==
The blue zone is called the surrounding area. This area isn't accessible by the player
*It's a bit less detailed compared to the playground
*The transition between the playground and surrounding should be as smooth as possible. The area shouldn't be too different from the playground except players can't go

=== The landscape area ===
The red zone is called the landscape area. Just like the surrounding area it's not accessible by the player
*Everything is very low poly and minimalist
*It gives a sense of depth and makes the world appear bigger than it really is
*The player shouldn't be able to see the tricks used (like simple 2D trees or fake mountain).

    <div class="inner_msg">
The frontier between the playground and surrounding should be very clear. The player should ALWAYS know where he/she can go. In Gran Paradiso Island you can see the separation with a small wall and palmtrees and heavy vegetation where the player can't go

== Concept art ==

Now we know what kind of area there will be in our Arena. We can start to paint/draw/create concepts :).

=== Creating the Arena ===
Since the whole playground will be rougly enclosed in the Arena It's a good idea to draw a concept for the arena.

As I said in the previous tutorial we want to create a unique building for the arena, we should create something never seen before and that will act as a landmark.

It won't be a generic stadium but THE STADIUM of LAS DUNAS.

*The stadium must something "never seen before"
*The stadium will be associated with the city of Las Dunas
**Hopefully when we will show it for the second time to people they will remember the city, SuperTuxKart, Las Dunas, etc.
*The stadium must have a view of the outside when you are inside

So now, let's take our pencil and paper and draw some ideas. A good rule is to make at least 9 different concepts to force yourself to be creative. They don't have to be perfect, just rough sketches to put your ideas on paper.

I made several tests. Let's analyses them to see which one we will take

*Picture 1
*Picture 2
*Picture 3

I started by a flower shape similar to a lotus, but I think it's not related to Las Vegas / Los Angeles. That concept will be better for a stadium in an Asian country.

The second concept is similar to a horseshoes. It might be funny to remember the "old west" horse races.

The last one is similar to a wave or sinusoid with a giant blimp hovering the stadium to hold the screens in the middle.
