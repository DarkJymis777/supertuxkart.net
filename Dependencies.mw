SuperTuxKart is based on a variety of other open-source software to avoid rewriting existing code. The current dependencies are:
* Irrlicht (custom version shipped with stk)
* Bullet (custom version shipped with stk)
* enet (currently a custom version is used, but this should change in the future)
* OpenGL (Support for >= 3.0, though other version might work)
* OpenAL (recommended: openal-soft-devel)
* Ogg
* Vorbis
* libcurl
* libbluetooth
* libglew
* xrandr (linux only)

== List of pages listing dependencies ==
Over the time, the depencies change and some fies and pages have to be updated, so here's a list of the most important lists to makes this easier:
* This page of course
* [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/blob/master/INSTALL.md INSTALL.md]
* [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt cmake]
* [[Build STK on Linux]]

Note that the dependency packages referenced [[Building and packaging on OSX|here]] and [[How to build the Windows version|here]] also need to be updated. (Normal hiker does does that for windows and auria for Mac OS X)
