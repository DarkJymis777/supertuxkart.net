== Nvidia Drivers ==

* Some shader with loops with a long body like GI makes the shader compiler crash.
Workaround : Manually unroll the loop.
* Passing sampler2D as varying between vertex shader and geometry shader make compiler crash
Workaround : User uvec2 type instead.
* Array of constants seem to be slower than normal when dynamic addressed.
Workaround : Use uniform arrays.
* On linux depth texture array with depthcomponent16 does not work.
Workaround : Commit b376dcd6fef825edf14cbab09924efe262223aab
* imageLoad() returns undefined values with out of bound index instead of 0 (as mentionned by the spec) on linux.
Workaround : Clamp indexes or use texture.
* atomics on shared memory (and to global memory to a lesser extent) like atomicMax in compute shaders make the display server hang/crash on Windows and Linux.
Workaround : Do not use atomics.

== Catalyst ==

* Samplers object seems not to be properly unbound when dealing with depth test and array texture like for shadowedsunlight shader.
Workaround : Use a dedicated texture unit for such samplers
* Bindless srgb textures are sampled like rgb textures
Workaround : Use #ifdefs and pow(., 2.2) to manually do the conversion
* imageLoad() returns undefined values with out of bound index instead of 0 (as mentionned by the spec) on linux.
Workaround : Clamp indexes or use texture.
* On linux libasan crash early because of overlapping memcpy addresses.
Workaround : Do not use libasan with catalyst
* Array textures with MSAA make the display driver on Windows crash and/or generates visual glitches.
Workaround : Use atlases or avoid MSAA
* Float arrays in UBO (when there are 2 UBOs) are not correctly staticaly addressed by shaders although it compiles.
Workaround : Names all field in the array manually.
* "#extension GL_AMD_vertex_shader_layer : enable" statement is not recognised.
Workaround :  GL_AMD_vertex_shader_layer behavior is enabled by default (ie you can write to gl_Layer in vertex shader) and it doesnt prevent the shader compilation so it's not an issue.

== Mesa ==

* On intel srgb Texture compression is broken.
Workaround : Do not use texture compression. This bug is also present on Intel Windows. Not sure it can be called a bug since texture compression is not part of the standard anyway.

== Intel Windows ==

* On Sandy Bridge UBO are not properly updated
Workaround : Do not use UBO
* srgb Texture compression is broken.
Workaround : Do not use texture compression. Not sure it can be called a bug since texture compression is not part of the standard anyway.
