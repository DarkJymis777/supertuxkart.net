It's important that SuperTuxKart has a consistent object style throughout. In many ways, this page is analogous to the texture guidelines.

== Style ==

Objects in SuperTuxKart should be realistic in size, shape, general form. However, objects should not be as detailed as in real life. Take a palm tree for example:

<gallery mode="packed" widths="300px" heights="200px">
File:RealPalmTree.jpg|A real palm tree
File:Supertuxkart-0.8.1-screenshot-2.png|Old, very cartoony palm tree model
File:Supertuxkart-0.9-screenshot-7.jpg|Modern, realistic, yet simplified model
</gallery>

You can see that the the new palm tree model far more closely matches the shape of a real palm tree. However, it is not so detailed that it looks real. In short, <u>maintain realism in general form, but also retain a cartoony appearance by avoiding excessive detail in shape or textures.</u>

== Rules ==

* All models '''MUST''' be child-friendly. SuperTuxKart should fit the ESRB "Everyone" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Ratings rating].
* Models should be capable of looking good both alone and in groups.
* High-poly models should make use of [[Level of Detail]].
* Avoid adding ground or vegetation around your objects, as this limits their usability in different scenarios.
