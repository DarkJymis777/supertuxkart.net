It's important that SuperTuxKart has a consistent object style throughout. In many ways, this page is analogous to the texture guidelines.

== Style ==

Objects in SuperTuxKart should be realistic in size, shape, general form. However, objects should not be as detailed as in real life. Take a palm tree for example:

<gallery mode="packed" widths="300px" heights="200px">
File:RealPalmTree.jpg|A real palm tree
File:Supertuxkart-0.8.1-screenshot-2.png|Old, cartoony palm tree model
File:Supertuxkart-0.9-screenshot-7.jpg|Modern, realistic, yet simplified model
</gallery>

You can see that the the new palm tree model far more closely matches the shape of a real palm tree. However, it is not so detailed that it looks real.
