Karts. Nitro. Action! SuperTuxKart is a 3D Open Source arcade kart racer with multiple characters, tracks and modes you can play. Beat the evil Nolok by any means necessary, and make the Cupcakes'N'Karts Empire safe once again!

We want to make the game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, race against each other or just try to beat the computer (a network multiplayer feature is under development).
