Karts. Nitro. Action! SuperTuxKart is a 3D Open Source arcade kart racer with multiple characters, tracks and modes you can play. Beat the evil Nolok by any means necessary, and make the mascot kingdom safe once again!

We want to make the game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, race against each other or just try to beat the computer (a network multiplayer feature is under development).

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode against your friends, and more!

There are also many user made track, karts and arenas available in-game as [http://addons.supertuxkart.net/ Add-ons].
