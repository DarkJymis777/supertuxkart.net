|title=What is SuperTuxKart
|answer=SuperTuxKart is a free 3D kart racing game; we want to make the game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each other or just try to beat the computer (a network multiplayer feature is under development).

See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the pyramids. Race under water or in space, watching the stars passing by. Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other karts overtaking you :) ). But don't eat the bananas!

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand Prix, or try to beat the high score in Time Trials on your own.

{{faq-question
|title=What is the history of SuperTuxKart?
|answer=First there was [http://tuxkart.sourceforge.net TuxKart]. Work on this happened (roughly) between April 2000 and March 2004. In June 2004, the 'Game of the Month' project of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20040915081722/http://www.happypenguin.org/ Linux Game Tome] decided to improve TuxKart. This was done between [https://web.archive.org/web/20090211231421/http://www.happypenguin.org/newroot/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1407&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 June and December 2004]. Unfortunately, this projected ended in a big disagreement, and it was finally decided to save the current state as "SuperTuxKart". While some graphical improvements were done, the code base itself was very unstable and practically unplayable. Nobody worked on (Super)TuxKart for several years.

In 2006, Joerg Henrichs (a.k.a. "Hiker") picked up SuperTuxKart, fixed the outstanding bugs and performance issues without any involvement of the original game designer or the GotM project. With the help of "Coz" a first release of STK was done in September 2006.

In May 2007, version 0.3 was released. It added high-score lists, a new track (Island), the time bomb, MacOSX support, and OpenAL support.

In February 2008 version 0.4 was released.  This version used Bullet Physics to improve the collision handling. "Auria" joined and started improving tracks (Shifting Sand, Lighthouse).

Version 0.5 was released in May 2008. It included many improved tracks, unlockable challenges, Follow-the-leader game mode, and more translations (OS language detector and matching to closest translation).

Version 0.6 was released on January 22, 2009. It had significantly improved gameplay; better physics with Nitro and skidding. The sound system was also improved, more interesting music was added and many new tracks and karts were added. It also saw the first special multi-player arena for 3-Strikes battle and new items/powerups to use.

Version 0.7 was released on December 20, 2010. It contained several significant improvements including: a new 3D rendering engine(Irrlicht),a new GUI (Graphical User Interface), new kart and track animations, new tracks, karts and items/powerups, and support for shortcuts/alternative paths. Versions 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3 were released shortly after with more improvements.

Version 0.8 was released in December 2012, adding a story mode and new challenges, improved AI and skidding, reverse mode, new tracks and music. The menus were also improved.

In 2015 we released the version 0.9 a groundbreaking release powered by a brand new game engine called Antarctica.

{{faq-question
|title=My computer is too old to run STK. What should I do?
|answer=You can try your luck and run the game. If it works, great! If it doesn't, we're sorry for you, but we can't support everything. We have a limited amount of manpower and time to support old GPUs. If we did try to support old GPUs, it would basically mean no new and advanced features.

|title=I want to help! What can I do?
|answer=* The [[ToDo|ToDo list]] and [https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/issues bug tracker] list the most important tasks, but you can of course also do something else.

* Have a look at the [[Community|Get involved]] Article. It should contain all the information you need to start with coding, modelling, desinging or whatever you'ld like to do.

* Contact the current developers and artist through the IRC (#stk on irc.freenode.net) or the [http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=16 forum] and tell them what you want to achieve.

|title=The AI (computer kart) shot backwards - how can I do this?
|answer=Most items (bowling ball, cake, plunger) can be used backwards. Just fire them while looking backwards.

{{faq-question
|title=Can I play STK on the internet?
|answer=The network support feature is under development. The basic support has been added in the Google Summer of Code 2013, but it's still not finished. See [[Networked Multiplayer]] (and pages linked from there) for more information.

{{faq-question
|title=Why some keyboard keys do not work when pressed simultaneously?
|answer=When playing with a keyboard, you may experience issues when pressing multiple keys simultaneously, for instance trying to use nitro while accelerating and turning. In such situations, some keypress may not register. This is however not a bug of SuperTuxKart, but a phyiscal limitation of your keyboard, most keyboards can only handle so many keys pressed at the same time ( for more detailed information, please check http://www.sjbaker.org/wiki/index.php?title=Keyboards_Are_Evil ). The solution is to use a gaming input device (gamepad, or gaming keyboard), or tweak the keys configuration to find keys that your keyboard will be able to register simultaneously.

{{faq-question
|title=I suddenly got a big red circle on my screen, what's that?
|answer=If there's a penguin in the middle of the circle, someone's shot a plunger at your face. You can do that to others by shooting the plunger backwards (see the FAQ entry about throwing items backwards). If there is no penguin, then it's a bug.

{{faq-question
|title=Where does STK store the user config file?
|answer=Note that STK 0.8.2 and STK 0.9 both store their config in the "0.8.2" folder because the config is compatible.

* On '''Windows''': It is in %APPDATA%/supertuxkart/0.8.2 (you can enter that in the Explorer and it will take you there)
* On '''Linux''': Either in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/supertuxkart/0.8.2 (first choice), ~/.config/supertuxkart/0.8.2 (second choice) or in ~/.supertuxkart/0.8.2 (third choice).
* On '''Mac OS X''': It is in ~/Library/Application Support/supertuxkart/0.8.2. Note that this directory may be hidden. 
You can also watch the output in the terminal to see if there is a note on where the config files are stored or search for a file called "config.xml".

{{faq-question
|title=The git version doesn't compile
|answer=This happens sometimes; The developers should be aware of that and it should be fixed soon. If [https://travis-ci.org/supertuxkart/stk-code Travis CI] says that the current git version compiles, but it doesn't do so for you, then propably something is wrong with your compiler setup. (Check if you have all dependencies, re-run cmake, ...)
}}
{{faq-question
|title=How do I unlock all tracks?
|answer=The intended in-game way is to play story mode and beat all challenges.

If however you want to unlock everything without playing story mode, you can also cheat by editing a config file. Open the folder mentionned above in question "Where does STK store the user config file". From there, open folder "0.8.2" then open file "players.xml". Replace all occurrences of "none" with "hard" (or "easy" or "medium", indicating the highest level at which you have solved a challenge).
