This page will explain how to build and packaged SuperTuxKart on mac OS X.


Please note that this is meant for developers and '''not''' casual users. 

Also see [[Source control]] to obtain the source code from git.


= Getting Started =
* Install developer tools, either from the OS X Install DVD or from Apple's website

* symlink include folder of OpenGL framework to /usr/local/include/GL (Unix programs have an easier time finding it this way)
<code>sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL</code>
(you might need to create <TT>/usr/local/include/</TT> first if you never built and installed anything from source! <TT>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/</TT>)


On OSX 10.9.5 I had to use (FIXME):

<code>
$ xcrun --show-sdk-path
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk
$ sudo ln -s  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include/  /usr/include
$ sudo ln -s  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers/ /usr/local/include/OpenGL</code>
The first link in order to find libcurl, the second to find opengl.

= Dependencies =
* Download pre-built dependencies [https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart%20Dependencies/OSX/ from here]
* Put the frameworks in [hard disk root]/Library/Frameworks


= CMake =
You can use the CMake build system to build STK. At this time CMake will not make a binary that is ready for distribution.

'''You'll have to run these commands inside your <TT>stk-code</TT> directory. The <TT>stk-assets</TT> directory has to be in the parent directory of <TT>stk-code</TT>'''

'''Building'''

With clang:
<code>mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
cmake ..
make
</code>


With GCC :
<code>mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc
make
</code>

'''Building on 10.10 with 10.9 compat'''
<code>cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9</code>

= Xcode =
1. Place an additional copy of the dependencies into <TT>Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Library/Frameworks</TT> <br>
2. In terminal, use <TT>cd</TT> to navigate to your cloned <TT>stk-code</TT> directory <br>
3. Execute the following commands:

<code>mkdir xcode_build && cd xcode_build
cmake .. -GXcode</code>

4. Use Finder to navigate to your <TT>stk-code/xcode_build</TT> folder and open the newly generated Xcode project (<TT>SuperTuxKart.xcodeproj</TT>) <br>
5. Build the project in Xcode: Product -> Build <br>

'''Note:''' Xcode is much less well tested than makefiles, so there may be issues when trying to use Xcode.
