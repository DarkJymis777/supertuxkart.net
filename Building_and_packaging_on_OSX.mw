This page will explain how I built and packaged SuperTuxKart on mac OS X.

For older versions, see [[Building STK 06 on OSX]]

In current SVN, STK is being ported to irrLicht. Please note that this is work-in-progress and '''not''' meant for casual users. Information below are notes i gathered about building STK with irrLicht.

= Dependencies =
* Download https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=202302&filename=DepsFrameworks.zip&a=73468757
* Put the frameworks in Library/Frameworks

== irrLicht ==
* Download irrLicht, and extract it.
Then build it using the provided Xcode project.

* copy ''libIrrlicht.a'' to ''/usr/local/lib''
<pre>
sudo cp ~/irrlicht-1.5/source/Irrlicht/MacOSX/build/Release/libIrrlicht.a /usr/local/lib/
</pre>
* copy ''include'' to ''/usr/local/include/irrlicht''
<pre>
sudo cp -R ~/irrlicht-1.5/include /usr/local/include/irrlicht
</pre>
* Build SuperTuxKart using the provided Xcode project (in /src/ide/)

The release build style will automatically build a 10.4-compatible, universal app bundle with data and frameworks inside (note: more work is required to make all of this flawless)

* Also note that with current SVN plib is stil required, though that dependdency should be gone by 0.7 final.
