This page will explain how to build and packaged SuperTuxKart on mac OS X.


Please note that this is meant for developers and '''not''' casual users. Information below are notes i gathered about building STK 0.7 with irrLicht 1.7+. For older versions of STK, see [[Building STK 06 on OSX]]

= Getting Started =
* Install developer tools, either from the OS X Install DVD or from Apple's website

* symlink include folder of OpenGL framework to /usr/local/include/GL (Unix programs have an easier time finding it this way)
<code>sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ /usr/local/include/GL</code>
(you might need to create <TT>/usr/local/include/</TT> first if you never built and installed anything from source! <TT>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/</TT>)

= Dependencies =
* Download pre-built dependencies [https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart%20Dependencies/OSX/ from here]
* Put the frameworks in [hard disk root]/Library/Frameworks
* Run the libintl installer if you don't already have libintl installed. (the installer will install a libintl dynamic library into /usr/local, universal binary that runs on OSX 10.4+)

= SuperTuxKart =

Build SuperTuxKart using the provided Xcode project (in /src/ide/)

That's all! If all went well, you're ready to run STK by hitting the big green 'run' button.

= Distributing =

The release build style will automatically build a 10.4-compatible, universal app bundle with data and frameworks inside.

Then the last step is to package libintl inside the application bundle, for this we use [http://macdylibbundler.sourceforge.net/ dylibbundler]

<code>dylibbundler -b -x ./SuperTuxKart.app/Contents/MacOS/supertuxkart -d ./SuperTuxKart.app/Contents/libs/ -od -p @executable_path/../libs/</code>
