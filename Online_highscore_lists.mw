Once the replay feature is created and sucessfully implemented, Time Trial highscore leaderboards should follow suit.

=== Setup should include: ===
- Top 10 records is standard for most games

- Info should include STK name, date, kart used, total time and lap splits

- Link to the [[replay]] when you doubleclick on the time

- Should reset each time a new STK version is released.

=== Online Time Trialing setup should be as follows: ===
- Only standard karts (in case someone does not have the addon kart installed)

- MINOR shortcuts allowed

- Limited number of laps to 2-4

- Only 4 saves allowed

- 1 zipper for each lap
