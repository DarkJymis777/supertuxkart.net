This article will explain how to translate STK into another language.

* Get poEdit from http://www.poedit.net/ or from your repositories on linux. (you may use other tools but the procedure for them is not documented here)
* Get latest STK (to get all latest strings)

The directory where you need to go is /data/po. There you will see a file named ''supertuxkart.pot'' and a script called ''update_pot.sh''. The .pot file contains all translatable strings of STK. The ''update_pot.sh'' script can be run from the base directory to update the .pot file, but you generally do not need to do that since the STK developers will do it for you.

== Configuring poEdit ==
* Make sure poEdit is configured to compile .mo files on saving (check in preferences)

* from the '''View''' memu, check '''Show automatic comments window'''. This will make a new area appear : this area will sometimes contain tips that the devs left to help you translate a string, for instance if its meaning is ambiguous.

== Creating a new translation ==
* Create a directory with your [http://xml.coverpages.org/iso639a.html language code] as name.

* Open poEdit and use menu '''File > New catalog from POT file'''.

* Select ''supertuxkart.pot''.

* Enter the appropriate information in the dialog that pops-up (ignore fields you do not understand or that do not make sense for this project. Only the first tab needs to be completed)

* Then simply select the strings in the list and enter a translation.
* When you're done, save the file as ''[language code].po''. Along it, a .mo file will be generated. Move the ''.mo'' file to /data/po/[language_code]/LC_MESSAGES/supertuxkart.mo.

* Then translate the following strings.
 (for extra users, copy the text, paste it then Translate button in Yahoo! Babelfish)

* To test, ''export LANG=[keycode]'' then run SuperTuxKart (on Unix systems)

== Updating an existing translation ==

* Open the ''language code.po'' file in poEdit.
* Choose ''Catalog > update from POT file''

* Select ''supertuxkart.pot''.

* You will then get a summary of changes (new and/or obsolete strings) if any.

* Then simply select the strings in the list and enter a translation.
* When you're done, save the file. Along it, a .mo file will be generated. Move the ''.mo'' file to /data/po/[language_code]/LC_MESSAGES/supertuxkart.mo.
