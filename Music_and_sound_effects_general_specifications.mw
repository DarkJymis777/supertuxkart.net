== Music ==

Music should be in ogg/vorbis format (.ogg extension). While mod files are currently used in the 0.3 version, support for this will be removed soon!

Try to keep the music file size under 5 megabytes.


We want most music to be light-hearted, but it is required that the music isn't 'aggressive' (we want to keep the game's ambient mostly happy). 

If you want to test your music in game, modify the *.track files in .../data, and add (or replace) the name of the .ogg files you want to play. If more than one is specified, one will be picked at random each time the track is started, see the following example for a modified version of data/race.track:
 
 ;; -*- mode: lisp -*-  
 
 (tuxkart-track
  (name "Race Track")
  (description "Created by Ingo Ruhnke")
  (music "/path/to/music1.ogg"  "/path/to/music2/ogg")   ;; modified/new entries
  (screenshot "images/sshot-race.rgb")
  (topview "images/topview-race.rgb")
 )


Also most music needs to be 'loopable', except :

*Grand Prix endings
*Game themes
*Anything else that doesn't makes sense to loop.

Also, please embed inside the file:
*The song's name if you wanted to give it a name (not required thought), because the file names are bound to be changed.
*The name of the author(s). Please don't delete the name of anyone, just append yours if you made a significant modification that you want to be recognized for. This isn't required, just if the song's author desires to do so.
*The date. Thought we use SVN to to track versions and changes to files, this might come in handy if SVN is not available or if the file was obtained through another way, which is the most likely situation for players.

== Sound effects ==

The format should be wave (.wav).

Try to keep the sound effect file size under 30 kilobytes.
