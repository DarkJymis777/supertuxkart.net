SuperTuxKart is able to install or uninstall add-ons on its own. This page includes details about that process, and instructions on how to install or remove add-ons either in-game or manually.

== Installing Add-Ons In-Game ==
Fixme: stub

== Installing Add-Ons Manually ==
Fixme: stub

== The Add-On Storage Folder ==
Depending on what system you are using, add-ons are installed to one of the following paths:

On Windows:
* %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\supertuxkart\addons\

On Linux:
* ~/.local/supertuxkart/addons/

On Mac OS X:
* (somebody who knows this, fill it in)


Within this folder, the following files and subdirectories exist:
* icons/, karts/, tmp/, tracks/, addons.xml, addons_installed.xml, news.xml

As you would expect, the karts and tracks folders contain the add-on kart and track directories, respectively.
