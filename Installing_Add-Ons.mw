Every officially approved Add-On can be easily installed using the in-game Add-On-Manager. But sometimes it's necessary to install or remove a track, kart or arena manually. This pages tries to provide the necessary information: 

== The Add-On Storage Folder ==
Depending on what system you are using, add-ons are installed in one of the following folders:

On Windows:
* %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\supertuxkart\addons\

On Linux:
* ~/.local/supertuxkart/addons/
* /usr/share/games/supertuxkart/data/tracks (for older STK versions)

On Mac OS X:
* ~/Application Support/SuperTuxKart/addons

== Installing and Removing ==
Within this folder, the following files and subdirectories exist: icons, karts, tmp, tracks, addons.xml, addons_installed.xml, news.xml

To install an Add-on, simply copy the whole folder with the Add-On to the correspondig subdirectory. Note that Arenas go in the track folder because they are technically tracks.

Uninstalling is done by removing that folder.
