Supertuxkart 0.8.2 and higher feature a custom engine called Antartica. '''It's not a standalone engine and we don't plan to make it standalone'''. It's designed to run only with supertuxkart.

The main feature of Antartica is a new renderer which currently supports OpenGL 4.0.

The engine is based on a heavily modified version of irrlicht. If you want more technical information about the engine you should read [[Antartica engine: Technical Details| this]]

<div id="dev_contrib">
== Dynamic Lighting ==
[[Image:Antartica_dynamiclight.jpg|center|800px]]
All lights are dynamic. Artists can place an arbitrary number of them. There is no "hard limit" however for performance the engine use only the 8, 16 or 32 closest lights to the player + the sun.

All lights can be animated if needed.
== Exponential Shadow Maps ==
[[Image:Antartica_dynamicshadows.jpg|center|800px]]

The sun cast automatically real time shadows to add more realism to the scene. You don't need precomputed [[lightmaps]] anymore.

== Realtime ambient occlusion ==

Before / after

Ambient occlusion is a shading technique to add darkness where objects and surface are close together, like cracks or corners.

== Depth of field and Bokeh ==
[[Image:antartica_dofbokeh.jpg|center|800px]]

When objects and lights are out of focus they are slightly blurred. Light sources appear as little dots like in real camera when a strong light source is out of focus.
More information about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh|bokeh]

== Bloom & lens flare ==
[[Image:antartica_bloom.jpg|center|800px]]

Each strong light source will [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_%28shader_effect%29| bloom] and produce [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensFlare| anamorphic lens flare]
== Global illumination & Image based lighting==

before/after

The surrounding environment will affect itself. Global illumination will simulate light bouncing on surfaces and the sky texture is used to make the ambient light.

== New solid material ==
[[Image:antartica_material.jpg|center|800px]]

Solid objects have a new generic material that support Normal mapping, Specular map, Emit map and much more. You can easily make a glossy surface or a metallic object.

==Volumetric Real time lights ==
[[Image:antartica_volumetric.jpg|center|800px]]

If fog is enabled in the scene, it is lit by light sources. It allows you to give more depth to your scene.

'''WARNING:''' Currently (supertuxkart 0.8.2) only point lights are supported. Cones still use the old billboard trick. However it's planned to support them later
