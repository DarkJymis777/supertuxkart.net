All lights are dynamic. Artists can place an arbitrary number of them. There is no "hard limit" however for performance the engine use only the 8, 16 or 32 closest lights to the player + the sun.

All lights can be animated if needed.

The sun cast automatically real time shadows to add more realism to the scene. You don't need precomputed [[lightmaps]] anymore.
