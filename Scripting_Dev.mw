===What is Scripting?===
Scripting provides dynamic binding of functions, classes and variables. Scripts are basically interpreted in a JIT (Just In Time) manner, which allows for a lot of configurability. Games benefit greatly from Scripting due to this configurability. Without scripting, creating a good game loop would require extensive amounts of hard coding. By scripting, the game engine functionality is exposed to the outside via an API. This allows the game logic to be changed at will without ever touching the game engine code. One added benefit is that you can simply change a lot of things without ever having to rebuild the game!
