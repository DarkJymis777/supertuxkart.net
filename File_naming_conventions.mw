All textures must use the same naming convention.

Naming are organised with this pattern
prefix_name_suffix.extension

* The prefix stk_ is required when the texture is global (in the data/textures repository)

* The name use the camel notation (thisIsAnExample) starting with a lower case. The first word must be the most describing for the texture. Example if you have a texture with a red wall a good name is wallRed. This allow to quickly find textures in a directory.

* The suffix is used to describe the function of the texture.
** diff = diffuse
** lm = lightmap
** spec = specular map
** nm = normal map
** ao = ambient occlusion
