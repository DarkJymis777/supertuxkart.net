== SuperTuxKart is applying for Google's Summer of Code 2013 ==
We are proud to announce that for the first time in the project's history, SuperTuxKart has applied to become a mentor organisation in this year's [https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013 Google Summer of Code] (GSoC). GSoc is a program where google will pay students to participate in open source projects full-time. This is a great chance for student to get developing experience while being helped by one of our experienced mentors, but also for STK to get new developers to implement new features. 

We don't know if we will be selected (which will be announced on April 8th), but if you are interested please have a look at our [[GSoC_overview|overview]] page, which gives some basic information about our GSoC application, and our [[GSoC_ideas|list of ideas]].


== SuperTuxKart will be SourceForge's "Project of the Month April" ==
We had a rather excellent result in the polls for SourceForge's "Project of the Month" - one of (if not the) highest number of votes by a hobby project . We lost to PostBooks in the end (which is actually a company with around 40 employees).

SourceForge decided because of our outstanding results and support from our fans to declare us "Project of the Month" in April (and also allow me to post this ahead of time).

Thank you very much to all our faithful fans for your votes! Thanks to all the countless blog and forum posts, and tweets, icons, videos, and everything. 


== SuperTuxKart as SourceForge's Project of the Month Contender ==
[[Image:Vote_stk.pngâ€Ž|left|link=http://vote.supertuxkart.net]] SuperTuxKart was just selected as one of the 9 project to compete for SourceForge's project of the month award in March. The actual decision is done by a public poll, so if you think that STK should win, please go to http://vote.supertuxkart.net, which will redirect you to the actual poll, where you can also see all competitors. We appreciate any votes, and any advertising you can do - e.g. postings in different languages so that we can reach a wider audience.

[[User:Hiker|Joerg]] and [[User:Auria|Auria]]  (April 4, 2011)

== SuperTuxKart 0.7 Released ==

After over a year of work, dozens upon dozens of new and fixed bugs, over 3000 commits, a lot of work from artists, restless testing from our faithful followers, and translations from contributors all over the world, we are thrilled to offer you SuperTuxKart 0.7 just in time for Christmas!

This release is using irrlicht for graphics, and features:
* New GUI.
* Kart and track animations.
* New and improved tracks, karts, and items.
* Shortcut/alternative way support for tracks.
* Asian fonts.
* Many, many bugfixes.

Enjoy!
[[User:Hiker|Joerg]] and [[User:Auria|Auria]]  (December 20, 2010)



== SuperTuxKart 0.7 Release Candidate 2 ==

We have just uploaded a second release candidate. Major changes include :

* Asian fonts are now included in the package.
* Several memory leaks have been fixed (which had caused problems with music and sound effects).
* Some tracks were improved to disable unintentional shortcuts and incorrect rescues.
* Some minor bug fixes.

We also updated the translations, but not all translations are complete yet. We encourage all translators to complete their translations, as the strings are now frozen.

Testing and feedback welcome!

Cheers,
[[User:Hiker|Joerg]] and [[User:Auria|Auria]]  (December 14, 2010)

== SuperTuxKart 0.7 release candidate 1 ==
After a burst of changes and fixes in the last few days we have finally released a first release candidate for 0.7:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/SuperTuxKart/0.7/.

The changes compared to 0.6.2a are too numerous to list, main points would be:
* New graphics engine.
* New GUI.
* Kart and track animations.
* New and improved tracks, karts, and items.
* Shortcut/alternative way support for tracks.

Compared to 0.7alpha3 challenges, unlocking etc. should all work now (though there is still a debug icon in the menu, which will be removed before the final release :oops: ).

The one thing missing are translations - since we added strings even in the last week, the translations are not up-to-date yet. If you want to help out with translations have a look at our wiki page: we are basically using launchpad, details are at http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/Translating_STK.

Feedback as always is welcome - be it here, or bugs in our tracker.

Cheers,

[[User:Hiker|Joerg]], December 1, 2010


== SuperTuxKart 0.7 alpha 3 released ==

In a bit of a rush, we finally managed to get a third alpha release of the upcoming 0.7 release out. You can download binary packages for Windows and Mac from the usual location at http://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/files/.

If you are compiling stk yourself note that it is recommended to use the current "1.7 stable" irrlicht branch, see [http://irrlicht.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/irrlicht/branches/releases/1.7 the branch in irrlicht's SVN repository] (which will become the next 1.7.2 release). While STK mostly still works with irrlicht 1.7.1, bugs in this irrlicht version can result in some texts not being displayed, and even in crashes (mostly in menus though).

This version shows very much work in progress, but we are getting closer to a release candidate. Hopefully this will motivate some artists to help us port/create a few more tracks, while we are busy fixing bugs and tuning some settings. Known bugs or issues are:

* Many challenges and GPs will be unavailable due to not-yet-converted tracks.
* The 'networking' menu is used to test the win/lose GP and unlocking animations. There is no networking support in 0.7 alpha 3 (nor will there be any in 0.7).
* Not all tracks have collectibles.
* AI needs tweaks, it does too good a job with slipstreaming, and on the other hand doesn't handle multiple items good enough.
* Disabling or enabling sound effects may require to restart STK for the change to apply correctly.
* Switching to windowed mode from fullscreen may fail on linux.
* If you build with irrlicht 1.7.1, you may get an empty race paused screen and/or a broken "feature unlocked" screen.
* If you do not exactly cross the lap line your lap may not be counted.
* If you add too many AI karts, the race may not start properly.
* In the kart selection screen, large karts might get clipped on sides.
* Kart animations not complete.
* The game may not allow you to configure bindings for gamepads other than the first one.
* The "slipstream" (follow behind a kart for a while with the slipstream effect showing, and you will get a zipper-like boost) and quick-start feature (press start very quickly _after_ 'GO') need tweaks.

We are looking forward to feedback, bug reports (please check with our bug tracker at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=202302&atid=981038 first), suggestions (though we are pretty much feature frozen for 0.7), and some contributions :)  .

Enjoy!

== SuperTuxKart 0.7 alpha 2 released ==

Hi all,

We have just released a 2nd alpha release of SuperTuxKart 0.7. This
version has a lot of improvements and bug fixes, more tracks, some new
icons and animations. It is still pretty much work in progress, and we
would love to get some feedback - e.g. does it work for you,
performance, do you like the new icon style or prefer the old one, bug
reports etc. Note that due to the missing tracks  GPs and challenges
will not work, and you will get a lot of warnings/error messages printed
- so please don't report issues related to challenges or GP not working ;)  .

We would also hope that people could help us to port more tracks - it's
not that much work, and would help us to get SuperTuxKart back to where
it was, especially getting the challenges and GPs back. Also more icons
would be nice - and of course always more tracks.

Enjoy!

== SuperTuxKart 0.7 alpha 1 released ==

After some long work porting SuperTuxKart to a new graphics engine, [http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/ irrLicht], as a replacement for the old and outdated [http://plib.sourceforge.net/ plib], we are proud to announce the first alpha release of the SuperTuxKart 0.7 development branch.

'''Important'''
This version of SuperTuxKart is an Alpha release, and as such is not stable
nor complete, and is meant solely for artists to port tracks over to the new
format. This binary can be used by the curious to take a look at where STK
is headed, but is not meant to be used to play.

'''Bugs'''
Before reporting any bug, make sure to check the list of known TODOs at
the following wiki page : [http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/ToDo#To_do_on_trunk_before_0.7_is_about_feature-complete].

For more information, take a look at the [http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=117 forum thread].

== Bugfix for Windows Vista: SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a ==
SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a fixes the problem that STK needed to be run as administrator in Windows Vista. There are no other changes, so no need to update if you are not on Windows Vista. If you have already used 0.6.2 you can just download a new windows binary and replace the old one.

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 23:00, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

== Bugfix release SuperTuxKart 0.6.2 ==
We have released SuperTuxKart 0.6.2 which fixes some bugs in the previous release, the most important being a crash that could happen now and again. But additionally we fixed slowdowns of karts in a battle area, scoring of Grand Prix in case of a restart, and more.

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 02:27, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

== New Website ==
SuperTuxKart just got a new look!

Hopefully you enjoy the renewed appearance. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to give feedback, the website is still to evolve =)  .

Thanks to Tom Jenkins from <del cite="http://tntwebmedia.com/blog/2009-05-22/rebirth">http://www.icecubewebdesign.co.uk/</del> <ins>http://www.tntwebmedia.com</ins> for designing this new look.

Hint: From the sound of the discussions, we might take inspiration from this new look to design the GUI of SuperTuxKart 0.7.

--[[User:Auria|Auria]] 15:09, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

== Minor bugfix release SuperTuxKart 0.6.1a ==
Due to a minor bug in the battle mode track selection we decided to release a minor bug fix release. New packages and patches for 0.6.1 are available from our download page.

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 13:51, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

== SuperTuxKart 0.6.1 released ==
SuperTuxKart version 0.6.1. fixes some minor bugs of the 0.6 release, adds a new kart, a new battle map, and better support for add-on packages. We also release a first add-on package, which contains 7 additional karts and 6 tracks. Some of the tracks and karts in this package are new, some are models that were removed from the main distribution. Note: you need SuperTuxKart 0.6.1 to use the add-on package. Both can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page.

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 02:06, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

== SuperTuxKart development blog ==
We now have a dedicated [http://supertuxkart.blogspot.com/ SuperTuxKart blog]. Arthur will report about latest developments of STK - so if you want to know what's currently happening, go and have a look. The developers might add a technical entry now and again as well :)  .

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 01:35, 5 February 2009 (UTC)



== SuperTuxKart 0.6 released ==
We have finally released SuperTuxKart 0.6. New in this version are improved physics and kart handling (including drifting and nitro speed boost), new  powerups (plunger, bowling ball, cake, bubblegum), new and improved tracks (skyline, snow mountain, race track, space track, old mine, XR591), a new multi-player game mode (3-Strikes Battle with two special arenas), improved and new kart models with a better AI, fully positional audio with OpenAL, new music and sound effects (including engine, braking and skidding sounds) and much more. A video of the gameplay can be found on Youtube [http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=Crn-VMUkg6w YouTube] or [http://www.vimeo.com/2891554 Vimeo] (higher quality). Binaries can be found on our [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page (though we are currently still waiting for a static linux binary).

--[[User:Hiker|Hiker]] 02:59, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

== '''SuperTuxKart 0.6 gameplay-video''' ==
I've created a gameplay-video of STK 0.6 and uploaded it to both vimeo and youtube. You may use it on your blogs and news to advertise the upcoming release. Sorry for not embedding it here, but i don't feel like installing extensions to our wiki for that.

== '''Looking for web master''' ==
We are looking for someone to help us keeping the web page up to date. Atm the web page is a media wiki, so while no programming skills are necessary some familiarity with a media wiki would be useful. Ideally we would like to have a complete redesign of our web page. If you are interested to help out, please contact us on the STK-devel list or on the #tuxkart irc channel.

== '''SuperTuxKart 0.6 RC1 released''' ==

We finally managed to release a first release candidate for SuperTuxkart 0.6. It offers (among a lot of new tracks and other improvements) improved physics with skidding, nitro, a better AI, and positional sound effects. Binaries for Macs, and Windows as well as source packages can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page. Feedback is welcome!

== '''SuperTuxKart version 0.5 released''' ==

Version 0.5 of SuperTuxKart has been released. It offers 6 new and improved tracks, a new game mode ('Follow the Leader'), new Grand Prix, some new music, and translations into German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Swedish. The new tracks and game modes need to be unlocked: you have to fulfill a challenge in order to use them. If all challenges are done, a preview of the upcoming skidding support can be tested. Binaries for Linux, Macs, and Windows as well as source packages can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page.
We hope you enjoy this release!

== Linux unstable binaries ==

Just uploaded a new binary of a recent SVN commit, that has some static linked libraries and the dynamic libraries are included, it was packaged by Sebastian Rode. Hopefully for the 0.5 stable release(yes, I don't mean the 0.4) we will use autopackage and things will be a lot simpler!

== New Windows binary of SVN version ==

I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version (1410). It contains many GUI and physics bug fixes, and should be 'more stable' than the previous test version. If you have any problems running this executable, please contact me (there might be a dll missing, but I can't test this on any systems I have access to).

== Windows binary of SVN version ==
I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version. While the current SVN version is not complete and not really stable, it will give all windows users who do not want to compile from SVN the opportunity to see where STK is heading.

== Bullet physics now default ==
Beginning with revision 1326 the bullet physics are now officially used in SuperTuxKart. This means that collision handling is significantly improved, and the game is much more fun. While not all old features have been ported yet, the game is already playable, and we are busy porting the missing features. Known bugs are listed on our [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=202302&atid=981038 bug tracker].

== Read this if this page looks yellow! ==
When I was working in the wiki, I deleted all the skins (except the classic skin which apparently cannot be deleted) and added the 'clean' skin. The behavior I expected (and what I understood from the comments in the file includes/Skin.php), is that all the others that had their selected skin deleted would fallback to the default, that is the clean skin. This is not what happened, instead falling back to the classic skin, causing that all users that were registered before the wiki website see a change from the clean skin to the classic skin when they log in. To fix this, all you have to do is to go to your preferences and change your default skin.

SuperTuxKart is an enhanced version of TuxKart, a kart racing game, originally done by Steve Baker, featuring Tux and a bunch of his friends. SuperTuxKart is the work of the GotM run for TuxKart at  happypenguin.org. It was recently picked up by a new pair of maintainers.

'''September 2006:''' We finally published a first official release: version 0.2. This version is the first playable version, and (among other things) contains the following updates compared to the last GotM version of SuperTuxKart:

* Performance improvements.
* Significant stronger computer controlled karts (which do not cheat anymore).
* Several grand prix.
* Two new collectables (anchor and anvil).

Compared with the original TuxKart the following improvements were done by the GotM team:

* New characters.
* New tracks.
* A completely new interface.
* Some smaller graphical improvements (animated wheels, etc.).
