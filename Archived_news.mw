== SuperTuxKart 0.7 alpha 2 released ==

Hi all,

we have just released a 2nd alpha release of SuperTuxKart 0.7. This
version has a lot of improvements and bug fixes, more tracks, some new
icons and animations. It is still pretty much work in progress, and we
would love to get some feedback - e.g. does it work for you,
performance, do you like the new icon style or prefer the old one, bug
reports etc. Note that due to the missing tracks  GPs and challenges
will not work, and you will get a lot of warnings/error messages printed
- so please don't report issues related to challenges or GP not working ;)

We would also hope that people could help us to port more tracks - it's
not that much work, and would help us to get SuperTuxKart back to where
it was, especially getting the challenges and GPs back. Also more icons
would be nice - and of course always more tracks.

Enjoy!

'''Downloads''' can be found at sourceforge : https://sourceforge.net/projects/supertuxkart/

== SuperTuxKart 0.7 alpha 1 released ==

After some long work porting SuperTuxKart to a new graphics engine, [http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/ irrLicht], as a replacement for the old and outdated [http://plib.sourceforge.net/ plib], we are proud to announce the first alpha release of the SuperTuxKart 0.7 development branch.

'''Important'''
This version of SuperTuxKart is an Alpha release, and as such is not stable
nor complete, and is meant solely for artists to port tracks over to the new
format. This binary can be used by the curious to take a look at where STK
is headed, but is not meant to be used to play.

'''Bugs'''
Before reporting any bug, make sure to check the list of known TODOs at
the following wiki page : [http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/ToDo#To_do_on_trunk_before_0.7_is_about_feature-complete]

For more information, take a look at the [http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=117 forum thread]

== Bugfix for Windows Vista: SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a ==
SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a fixes the problem that STK needed to be run as administrator in Windows Vista. There are no other changes, so no need to update if you are not on Windows Vista. If you have already used 0.6.2 you can just download a new windows binary and replace the old one.

== Bugfix release SuperTuxKart 0.6.2 ==
We have released SuperTuxKart 0.6.2 which fixes some bugs in the previous release, the most important being a crash that could happen now and again. But additionally we fixed slowdowns of karts in a battle area, scoring of Grand Prix in case of a restart, and more.

== New Website ==
SuperTuxKart just got a new look!

Hopefully you enjoy the renewed appearance. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to give feedback, the website is still to evolve =)

Thanks to Tom Jenkins from <del cite="http://tntwebmedia.com/blog/2009-05-22/rebirth">http://www.icecubewebdesign.co.uk/</del> <ins>http://www.tntwebmedia.com</ins> for designing this new look.

Hint: From the sound of the discussions, we might take inspiration from this new look to design the GUI of SuperTuxKart 0.7

== Minor bugfix release SuperTuxKart 0.6.1a ==
Due to a minor bug in the battle mode track selection we decided to release a minor bug fix release. New packages and patches for 0.6.1 are available from our download page.

== SuperTuxKart 0.6.1 released ==
SuperTuxKart version 0.6.1. fixes some minor bugs of the 0.6 release, adds a new kart, a new battle map, and better support for add-on packages. We also release a first add-on package, which contains 7 additional karts and 6 tracks. Some of the tracks and karts in this package are new, some are models that were removed from the main distribution. Note: you need SuperTuxKart 0.6.1 to use the add-on package. Both can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page.

== '''SuperTuxKart 0.6 gameplay-video''' ==
I've created a gameplay-video of STK 0.6 and uploaded it to both vimeo and youtube. You may use it on your blogs and news to advertise the upcoming release. Sorry for not embedding it here, but i don't feel like installing extensions to our wiki for that.

== '''Looking for web master''' ==
We are looking for someone to help us keeping the web page up to date. Atm the web page is a media wiki, so while no programming skills are necessary some familiarity with a media wiki would be useful. Ideally we would like to have a complete redesign of our web page. If you are interested to help out, please [[Contact_us | contact us]] on the STK-devel list or on the #tuxkart irc channel.

Binaries for Macs, and Windows as well as source packages can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page. Feedback is welcome!

Version 0.5 of SuperTuxKart has been released. It offers 6 new and improved tracks, a new game mode ('Follow the Leader'), new Grand Prix, some new music, and translations into German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Swedish. The new tracks and game modes need to be unlocked: you have to fulfill a challenge in order to use them. If all challenges are done, a preview of the upcoming skidding support can be tested. Binaries for Linux, Macs, and Windows as well as source packages can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page.
We hope you enjoy this release!

== Linux unstable binaries ==

Just uploaded a new binary of a recent SVN commit, that has some static linked libraries and the dynamic libraries are included, it was packaged by Sebastian Rode. Hopefully for the 0.5 stable release(yes, I don't mean the 0.4) we will use autopackage and things will be a lot simpler!

== New Windows binary of SVN version ==

I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version (1410). It contains many GUI and physics bug fixes, and should be 'more stable' than the previous test version. If you have any problems running this executable, please contact me (there might be a dll missing, but I can't test this on any systems I have access to).

== Windows binary of SVN version ==
I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version. While the current SVN version is not complete and not really stable, it will give all windows users who do not want to compile from SVN the opportunity to see where STK is heading.

== Bullet physics now default ==
Beginning with revision 1326 the bullet physics are now officially used in SuperTuxKart. This means that collision handling is significantly improved, and the game is much more fun. While not all old features have been ported yet, the game is already playable, and we are busy porting the missing features. Known bugs are listed on our [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=202302&atid=981038 bug tracker].

== Read this if this page looks yellow! ==
When I was working in the wiki, I deleted all the skins (except the classic skin which apparently cannot be deleted) and added the 'clean' skin. The behavior I expected (and what I understood from the comments in the file includes/Skin.php), is that all the others that had their selected skin deleted would fallback to the default, that is the clean skin. This is not what happened, instead falling back to the classic skin, causing that all users that were registered before the wiki website see a change from the clean skin to the classic skin when they log in. To fix this, all you have to do is to go to your preferences and change your default skin.

SuperTuxKart is an enhanced version of TuxKart, a kart racing game, originally done by Steve Baker, featuring Tux and a bunch of his friends. SuperTuxKart is the work of the GotM run for TuxKart at  happypenguin.org. It was recently picked up by a new pair of maintainers.

'''September 2006:''' We finally published a first official release: version 0.2. This version is the first playable version, and (among other things) contains the following updates compared to the last GotM version of SuperTuxKart:

* performance improvements
* significant stronger computer controlled karts (which do not cheat anymore)
* several grand prix
* two new collectables (anchor and anvil)

Compared with the original TuxKart the following improvements were done by the GotM team:

* new characters
* new tracks
* a completly new interface
* some smaller graphical improvements (animated wheels, etc.)
