== '''SuperTuxKart version 0.5 released''' ==

Version 0.5 of SuperTuxKart has been released. It offers 6 new and improved tracks, a new game mode ('Follow the Leader'), new Grand Prix, some new music, and translations into German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Swedish. The new tracks and game modes need to be unlocked: you have to fulfill a challenge in order to use them. If all challenges are done, a preview of the upcoming skidding support can be tested. Binaries for Linux, Macs, and Windows as well as source packages can be found on our [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202302 download] page.
We hope you enjoy this release!

== Linux unstable binaries ==

Just uploaded a new binary of a recent SVN commit, that has some static linked libraries and the dynamic libraries are included, it was packaged by Sebastian Rode. Hopefully for the 0.5 stable release(yes, I don't mean the 0.4) we will use autopackage and things will be a lot simpler!

== New Windows binary of SVN version ==

I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version (1410). It contains many GUI and physics bug fixes, and should be 'more stable' than the previous test version. If you have any problems running this executable, please contact me (there might be a dll missing, but I can't test this on any systems I have access to).

== Windows binary of SVN version ==
I just created a simple windows binary of the current SVN version. While the current SVN version is not complete and not really stable, it will give all windows users who do not want to compile from SVN the opportunity to see where STK is heading.

== Bullet physics now default ==
Beginning with revision 1326 the bullet physics are now officially used in SuperTuxKart. This means that collision handling is significantly improved, and the game is much more fun. While not all old features have been ported yet, the game is already playable, and we are busy porting the missing features. Known bugs are listed on our [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=202302&atid=981038 bug tracker].

== Read this if this page looks yellow! ==
When I was working in the wiki, I deleted all the skins (except the classic skin which apparently cannot be deleted) and added the 'clean' skin. The behavior I expected (and what I understood from the comments in the file includes/Skin.php), is that all the others that had their selected skin deleted would fallback to the default, that is the clean skin. This is not what happened, instead falling back to the classic skin, causing that all users that were registered before the wiki website see a change from the clean skin to the classic skin when they log in. To fix this, all you have to do is to go to your preferences and change your default skin.

SuperTuxKart is an enhanced version of TuxKart, a kart racing game, originally done by Steve Baker, featuring Tux and a bunch of his friends. SuperTuxKart is the work of the GotM run for TuxKart at  happypenguin.org. It was recently picked up by a new pair of maintainers.

'''September 2006:''' We finally published a first official release: version 0.2. This version is the first playable version, and (among other things) contains the following updates compared to the last GotM version of SuperTuxKart:

* performance improvements
* significant stronger computer controlled karts (which do not cheat anymore)
* several grand prix
* two new collectables (anchor and anvil)

Compared with the original TuxKart the following improvements were done by the GotM team:

* new characters
* new tracks
* a completly new interface
* some smaller graphical improvements (animated wheels, etc.)
