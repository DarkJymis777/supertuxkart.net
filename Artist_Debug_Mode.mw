Starting from SuperTuxKart 0.7.1, all STK builds contain a hidden track debugging mode packed with features to make it easier for artists to make tracks.

Before starting, let me remind you that there is a feature always enabled to let you start directly into a track, so that you don't need to go through the menus everytime. Simply launch STK from terminal with

<pre>
supertuxkart -N -t trackname
</pre>

where "trackname" is the name of the directory your track is in.

Furthermore, if you encounter problems, make sure to '''run Supertuxkart from terminal''', there you may be able to see error messages related to your track.

== Enabling the debug mode ==

When STK is closed, open the STK config file (on OSX, it's [HOME]/Library/Application Support/SuperTuxKart ; on Linux it's usually ~/.config/supertuxkart)

locate the line that reads
<pre>
    <!-- Whether to enable track debugging features -->
    <artist_debug_mode value="false" />
</pre>

and change it to

<pre>
    <!-- Whether to enable track debugging features -->
    <artist_debug_mode value="true" />
</pre>

== The new features you get ==

Feature that is triggered automatically :
* If there is no ground under the area where karts start, normally STK will print an error message on the terminal and abort; in debug mode, however, the kart will just hover so you can see what the problem is

'''Note''' : many of the tools below use keyboard bindings; of course you will need to make sure your keyboard configuration does not assign these keys to something else if you wish to be able to use them

=== Add-ons at will ===

Nitro and zippers are especially helpful in order to quickly get to an area far from the start

* F1 : bubblegums
* F2 : plungers
* F3 : cakes
* F4 : switches
* F5 : bowling balls
* F6 : parachutes
* F7 : zippers
* F8 : nitro

=== Hide karts and race GUI ===
This is especially useful when you need to take the screenshot of your track, to get all annoyances out of the way
* Ctrl+F8

=== View faces and normals ===
You can cycle through several debug draw modes, namely to see polygons and normals, by pressing Ctrl+F11

=== Fly! ===

STK has a secret ability : karts may be instantly turned into flying devices. This is quite useful to take a closer look at meshes that aren't too visible from the road, or to skip large portions of a track to go straight to the area you're interested in.

* I : fly up (press repeatedly if needed)
* K : fly down (press repeatedly if needed)

=== A different viewpoint ===
Launch supertuxkart from the terminal with the <tt>--camera-debug</tt> argument, the camera will be placed from above, allowing you to see what's going on from a different perspective

=== Debug checklines ===
Launch supertuxkart from the terminal with <TT>--check-debug</TT> argument, and you will visually see where checklines are; active checklines will appear as red, inactive ones as white; and information about which kart crosses which checkline will be printed on the terminal.
