Starting from SuperTuxKart 0.7.1, all STK builds contain a hidden track debugging mode packed with features to make it easier for artists to make tracks.

== Enabling the debug mode ==

When STK is closed, open the STK config file (on OSX, it's [HOME]/Library/Application Support/SuperTuxKart ; on Linux it's usually ~/.config/supertuxkart)

locate the line that reads
<pre>
    <!-- Whether to enable track debugging features -->
    <artist_debug_mode value="false" />
</pre>

and change it to

<pre>
    <!-- Whether to enable track debugging features -->
    <artist_debug_mode value="true" />
</pre>

== The new features you get ==

'''Note''' : many of the tools below use keyboard bindings; of course you will need to make sure your keyboard configuration does not assign these keys to something else if you wish to be able to use them

=== Add-ons at will ===

Nitro and zippers are especially helpful in order to quickly get to an area far from the start

* F1 : bubblegums
* F2 : plungers
* F3 : cakes
* F4 : switches
* F5 : bowling balls
* F6 : parachutes
* F7 : zippers
* F8 : nitro

=== Hide karts and race GUI ===
This is especially useful when you need to take the screenshot of your track, to get all annoyances out of the way
* Ctrl+F8

=== View faces and normals ===
You can cycle through several debug draw modes, namely to see polygons and normals, by pressing F11


=== Fly! ===

STK has a secret ability : karts may be instantly turned into flying devices. This is quite useful to take a closer look at meshes that aren't too visible from the road, or to skip large portions of a track to go straight to the area you're interested in.

* I : fly up (press repeatedly if needed)
* K : fly down (press repeatedly if needed)
