LOD = Level of Detail. To improve performance the engine can display a high quality object close to the player, a medium quality object in the vicinity of the player and a very low quality object far away.

=== LOD tutorial ===

Start by creating the various models with different levels of detail, and give them type '''LOD Model'''. Place them anywhere in the track, these particular models won't be visible in-game. Then place an object in the track where the LOD object should be instanciated and give it type '''LOD Instance''' (you can place any model on the track; it could be a cube, etc. but of course usually it's more helpful to place the actual model).

For instance, here is the example of how to setup a LOD sphere :

[[File:Lod_low.png|center|650px]]
(20 polygons)
<br>
[[File:Lod_medium.png|center|650px]]
(100 polygons)
<br>
[[File:Lod_high.png|center|650px]]
(1000 polygons)

A good rule of thumb is: each lower model should have half the number of polygons compared to the previous one.

The various models that represent various definitions of the same object should all receive the same '''LOD group name'''.

Once the 3 levels are defined, you are ready to place instances of the sphere in the track, setting the '''LOD group name''' of the object you want to appear there :
[[File:Lod_instance.png|center]]

The result in-game will be that, at this location :
* The highest resolution sphere will be visible if you are 50 meters or closer from the object
* The medium resolution sphere will be visible if you are between 50 and 100 meters from the object
* The low resolution sphere will be visible if you are between 100 and 200 meters from the object
* If you are further away than 200 meters away from the object, it will not be shown at all
