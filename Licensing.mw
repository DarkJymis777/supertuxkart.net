Licensing is not the most exciting topic, but if you wish to contribute, you will absolutely need to read it.


== Why ==
Since SuperTuxKart is included in many linux distributions with strict license requirements (e.g. Debian), we cannot accept tracks/karts/textures/etc. with unclear licensing terms.
Furthermore, we are hosted (freely, I am add) by SourceForge, which requires that all hosted materials be released under open licenses; therefore posting materials with improper licenses would violate our terms of hosting


== Considerations to always keep in mind ==

If you wish that your contribution be included in STK main or add-ons, '''always note down the author's name, website where image was found and full license name of everything you use (textures, models, sounds, etc.); when you make something yourself also note that you do it yourself and which license you release is under; we recommend making a file named "License.txt" to contain all this information; if we do not receive this information along your track/kart/etc., we will be legally unable to use your contribution in any way'''


== Which licenses? ==

Our license of choice is Creative-Commons-By-SA 3+.

* Note that "I asked the guy and he said 'yeah you can use it'" is ''not'' a valid license (yup, happened)
* Also note that even if you modify the image you do not have a general right to modify the license of your modified version, changing of license must be explicitly granted by the license of the work in question.


'''These licenses are acceptable''' : CC-BY 3.0, CC-BY-SA 3.0, GPL, LGPL, Apache License, Mozilla License, Artistic, MIT, BSD License, X11 license, Public Domain


'''These licenses are NOT acceptable''' : CC-BY 2.5 or before, CC-BY-SA 2.5 or before, GNU Free Documentation License, Creative Commons Sampling Plus, any Creative Commons with the "Non-Commercial" clause, Free Art License, [http://www.cgtextures.com/ CGTextures License], [http://imageafter.com Image*After Terms], [http://mayang.com/textures Mayang license], [http://texturearchive.com TextureArchive Terms], "Creative Commons" alone without a version number and without full name


For other licenses, we need to check on a case-by-case basis

== Where to find files ==

All of the following websites offer material in an acceptable license (note that I do not say they ''only'' use acceptable licenses, so please still check the license on a case by case basisis) : [http://pdphoto.org/ PD Photo], [http://www.burningwell.org/ BurningWell], [http://www.ccmixter.org/ ccmixter], [http://www.pdsounds.org/ pdsounds], [http://soundbible.com/ sound bible], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page wikimedia commons], [http://www.texturemate.com/ TextureMate], [http://opengameart.org/ OpenGameArt]
