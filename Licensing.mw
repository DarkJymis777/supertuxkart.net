Licensing is not the most exciting topic, but if you wish to contribute, you will absolutely need to read it.


== Why ==
Since SuperTuxKart is included in many linux distributions with strict license requirements (e.g. Debian), we cannot accept tracks/karts/textures/etc. with unclear licensing terms.
Furthermore, we are hosted (freely, I might add) by SourceForge, which requires that all hosted materials be released under open licenses; therefore posting materials with improper licenses would violate our terms of hosting

== Considerations to always keep in mind ==

If you wish that your contribution be included in STK main or add-ons, '''always note down the author's name, website where image was found and full license name of everything you use (textures, models, sounds, etc.); when you make something yourself also note that you did it yourself and which license you release is under; we recommend making a file named "License.txt" to contain all this information; if we do not receive this information along your track/kart/etc., we will be legally unable to use your contribution in any way'''

If you reuse a texture from another STK track, ideally still note down its author and license, by reading the appropriate License.txt file, a simple reference to another track makes things very hard to follow (rationale : the other track might get removed, or the original texture may be replaced with another texture of a different license or by another author, and then all links between tracks from license files become broken)

== Which licenses? ==

Our license of choice is Creative-Commons-By-SA 3+.

* Note that "I asked the guy and he said 'yeah you can use it'" is ''not'' a valid license (yup, happened). (If you ask someone to release their work for use in STK, please request an explicit statement that the work be released under CC-BY-SA 3.0, or GPL, or another free license)
* Also note that even if you modify the work (image, model, ...), '''in general you do not have the legal right to change the license''' of your modified version; changing of license must be explicitly granted by the license of the work in question, or by the author.


'''These licenses are acceptable''' : CC-BY 3.0, CC-BY-SA 3.0, GPL, LGPL, Apache License, Mozilla License, Artistic, MIT, BSD License, X11 license, Public Domain


'''These licenses are NOT acceptable''' : CC-BY 2.5 or before, CC-BY-SA 2.5 or before, GNU Free Documentation License, Creative Commons Sampling Plus, any Creative Commons with the "Non-Commercial" clause, any Creative Commons with the "No Derivatives" clause, Free Art License, [http://www.cgtextures.com/ CGTextures License], [http://imageafter.com Image*After Terms], [http://mayang.com/textures Mayang license], [http://texturearchive.com TextureArchive Terms], "Creative Commons" alone without a version number and without full name


For other licenses, we need to check on a case-by-case basis

== Combinations ==

There is yet another thing to consider :
* Not all licenses are compatible which each other. This means '''you need to be extra careful when combining works that are under different licenses'''.
** For instance, I ([[User:Auria]]) have no idea if CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GPL are compatible. This means that if you make a texture by combining elements from a CC-BY-SA 3.0 texture and from another GPL texture, we will be in unknown territory until someone can give us legal advice whether this is possible or not.
