Licensing is not the most exciting topic, but if you wish to contribute, you will absolutely need to read it.


== Why ==
Since SuperTuxKart is included in many linux distributions with strict license requirements (e.g. Debian), we cannot accept tracks/karts/textures/etc. with unclear licensing terms.
Furthermore, we are hosted (freely, I might add) by SourceForge, which requires that all hosted materials be released under open licenses; therefore posting materials with improper licenses would violate our terms of hosting

== Considerations to always keep in mind ==

If you wish that your contribution be included in STK main or add-ons, '''always note down the author's name, website where image was found and full license name of everything you use (textures, models, sounds, etc.); when you make something yourself also note that you did it yourself and which license you release is under; we recommend making a file named "License.txt" to contain all this information; if we do not receive this information along your track/kart/etc., we will be legally unable to use your contribution in any way'''

If you reuse a texture from another STK track, ideally still note down its author and license, by reading the appropriate License.txt file, a simple reference to another track makes things very hard to follow (rationale : the other track might get removed, or the original texture may be replaced with another texture of a different license or by another author, and then all links between tracks from license files become broken)

== Which licenses? ==

Our license of choice is Creative-Commons-By-SA 3+.

* Note that "I asked the guy and he said 'yeah you can use it'" is ''not'' a valid license (yup, happened)
* Also note that even if you modify the image you do not have a general right to modify the license of your modified version, changing of license must be explicitly granted by the license of the work in question.
