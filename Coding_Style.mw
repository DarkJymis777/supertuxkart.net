This is our preferred coding style. It was inspired by Google's coding style at http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml, but this set is only a small subset of it. Currently, not all our sources are following this style, and we welcome any patches to improve this.

Most of the sources follow this coding style, and the rest is being re-styled as we continue development.

== File names and directories ==
* All include files should end in .hpp, all sources are .cpp (this allows shell commands to easily specify all sources: *.?pp).
* All file names are in lower case, with _ as a word separator, e.g.: grand_prix_ending.hpp (while classes inside the files will use camel case, e.g. GrandPrixEnding).
* Files should be grouped in appropriate subdirectories. Avoid having more than one level of subdirectories, though atm we have src/guiengine/widgets, src/karts/controller, and states_screens/dialogs using this.
* The file names should represent the name of the classes it contains, e.g. grand_prix_ending.hpp contains the class GrandPrixEnding (see [[#Coding]] below). Not more than one class should be declared inside a single file.

== Including files ==
* In file XX.cpp first include the corresponding XX.hpp file if available (this guarantees that the header has no hidden dependencies). Then include:
** STK header files.
** Libraries that are included with the STK source code (bullet, enet, irrlicht),
** External libraries used by STK (OpenAL, ...),
** System files and STL,
** Sort the header files alphabetically in each sections - e.g. for STK sources: first files in src, then the files from the different subdirs. This makes it much easier to spot if a file is included more than once.
* Use a #ifdef header guard in the following form to protect against multiple include:  HEADER_FILE_NAME_HPP. I.e. HEADER_ followed by the filename in all caps, with "." replaced by "_".
* Even when including a .hpp file that is in the same subdir (say gui/menu_manager.hpp in gui/char_sel.cpp), use the path including the subdir, i.e.:<pre> #include "gui/menu_manager.hpp"</pre>and not<pre> #include "menu_manager.hpp"</pre>This makes it easier to move files into different directories.
* If possible, use a simple 'class XYZ' forward declarations instead of including the header file. This will reduce the amount of recompilation necessary when modifying files (see http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Header_File_Dependencies for more details). Even if this means that small functions that could be inlined are moved from the header file to the cpp file (unless it's a time critical function).

== Layout ==
* 4 spaces for indentation
* '''no tabs'''
** Using tabs means that the files might be displayed differently from one editor to the next, or when viewed in a terminal. All editors have an option to use spaces instead of tabs.
* Both the opening and the closing braces should be on a line of their own. That means:
<pre>int main()
{
    return 0;
}</pre>

Exceptions to this are one line functions in header files:

<pre> float getValue() const { return m_my_value; }</pre>

* In header files try to align declaration and definitions in columns (e.g. first column type, 2nd column function name). This might not always be possible, but a more structured header file is easier to read and understand). Example:
    NetworkMode  getMode() const                   {return m_mode;           }
    void         becomeServer();
    void         becomeClient();
    void         setState(NetworkState s)          {m_state = s;             }
    NetworkState getState() const                  {return m_state;          }
    int          getMyHostId() const               {return m_host_id;        }
    void         setHostId(int host_id)            {m_host_id = host_id;     }
    unsigned int getNumClients() const             {return m_num_clients;    }
    const std::string& 
                 getClientName(int i) const        {return m_client_names[i];}
    bool         initialiseConnections();
    void         update(float dt);

* Start with private declarations, then the public ones (this might be a bit unusual: the idea is that the doxygen output is sorted with public declarations first, which is what people studying the code should look like. If you are actually looking at the sources, you are more likely interested in the implementation, so having this come first saves scrolling down time).
* Try not to use more than 80 characters in a line.
* Have a line "// ------------------------" (up to 80th column) separate each function definition (see [[#Doxygen]] for an example)
* If the closing } is more than a few lines away from the opening {, or if there are multiple curly braces in-between, add a comment indicating what this } closes. This comment can be an informal comment, or just be the corresponding opening statement. E.g: <pre>}   // for i in all karts</pre> or <pre>}   // for(int i=0; i<m_num_karts; i++)</pre>
* It should be avoided to have more than one class in a file

== Doxygen ==
Use Doxygen comments. The comments for variables should be just before their declaration, and functions should be documented where they are implemented, and not where they are defined. I.e. don't document functions in the header file if they are implemented in the corresponding cpp file. Reason for this is that this way the documentation is on the screen when you debug. If you want to study the interface of a class, just look at the doxygen documentation, and all information is on one screen. But if you debug you want to know what a function is doing, then having to look at the header file is annoying. It's also easier to keep implementation details and comments in sync.

The following format should be used (Doxyfile is set up to use the first sentence as a brief description). 
 /** This function is called when the AI is trying to hit an item that is 
  *  pre-selected to be collected. The AI only evaluates if it's still
  *  feasible/useful to try to collect this item, or abandon it (and then 
  *  look for a new item). At item is unselected if the kart has passed it 
  *  (so collecting it would require the kart to reverse).
  *  \pre m_item_to_collect is defined
  *  \param kart_aim_angle The angle towards the current aim_point.
  *  \param aim_point The current aim_point.
  *  \param last_node
  *  \return True if th AI should still aim for the pre-selected item.
  */
 bool SkiddingAI::handleSelectedItem(float kart_aim_angle, Vec3 *aim_point)
 {
 }   // handleSelectedItem

Feel free to use more commands like \pre, \param, \return from doxygen.

== Coding ==
* Use const instead of #define if possible.
* References should only be used as const: const Kart &k . If an object is modified, pass it in as a pointer. This makes it more obvious which values are modified.
* If possible, all parameters of functions should be const correct (i.e. if it's not modified, it should be declared const).
* Try to sort parameters with input first, then output parameters.
* Compile time constant values should be all uppercase, e.g.  const float PI=3.1415 .
* Member variables start with m_ , e.g. m_kart .
* Variable names are lower case separated by '_'. Example: sun_position (member variable: m_kart_pointer).
* Function names should be capitalized, except the first word. Example: getWidth(). 
* Type(including classes/struct/enum) names have all their words capitalized. Example: KartControl.
* Use true/false instead of TRUE/FALSE. In [http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-devel&m=111737503228222&w=2] it's written that uppercase booleans are used only for older compilers, so we should try to avoid this inconsistency.
* Use std::string instead of char*. If you need a C-style string, use the function std::string.c_str(). However, there are cases when this cannot be avoided(like when using strings with gettext).
* Use std::min() / std::max() instead of a #define (windows needs NOMINMAX to be defined before including windows.h).
