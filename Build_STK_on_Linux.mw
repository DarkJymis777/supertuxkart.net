This page collects information about the irrlicht port. Note that the irrlicht branch is _completely_ unstable, and we will most likely not be able to offer any support regarding bugs, how to compile, ... 

== Installing Irrlicht ==
For now the build environment assumes that irrlicht is used from the installed irrlicht source directory.
<!--
You have to compile irrlicht yourself to enable SDL support in irrlicht. In the file .../include/IrrCompileConfig.h define the symbol _IRR_USE_SDL_DEVICE_  (the line is already in the file, but commented out) and then compile.
-->
If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Getting the sources and compiling ==
The irrlicht version is now on the default trunk at:
 http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk

If you have been using the irrlicht branch switch to trunk by using:
 svn switch http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk .

To configure you have to use the option --with-irrlicht=/PATH/TO/IRRLICHT, unless you have irrlicht installed in system directories that are searched by the compiler automatically. Neither plib nor sdl are necessary anymore, though the other dependencies (openal, ogg, vorbis) still exist.

== Running ==
Only a few tracks have been converted so far (beach, jungle and lighthouse track). The GUI is mostly working, so you can race in those tracks any way you like. Still, the irrlicht version is currently stable, and we consider it only to be 'somewhat' playable.

== Exporting Tracks ==
A new [[track_exporter | track exporter]] is under development.
