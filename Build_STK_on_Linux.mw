== Installing dependencies ==

First of all, you will need a compiler and the autotools build system
 sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential
Or
 sudo aptitude install autoconf automake build-essential
Other needed dependencies are : openal, ogg, vorbis. For ubuntu/debian :

 sudo apt-get install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev

Or

 sudo aptitude install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev


== Installing Irrlicht ==
Start by installing irrlicht from your repositories if it is found there, otherwise check [http://www.irrlicht3d.org/wiki/index.php?n=Main.InstallingIrrlicht How to Install Irrlicht] from the irrlicht wiki.

The latest SVN trunk of SuperTuxKart uses the trunk of irrlicht, which can be found at
 https://irrlicht.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/irrlicht/trunk

Go in /Source/Irrlicht inside that. Note that it's recommended to build irrlicht in release mode for full performance (default is debug mode)
<code>NDEBUG=1 make</code>

The build environment can use irrlicht either from an installed irrlicht package (e.g. in /usr/local), or directly from the irrlicht source tree. Configure should detect installation in default directories (/usr, /usr/local). '''It is recommended not to install irrlicht to /usr or /usr/local if you build it from source. Just leave it in place, this will be cleaner.''' See below to help the build system find your irrlicht.

SuperTuxKart 0.7.1 should be built using irrlicht 1.8 (trunk at the time of this writing since 1.8 stable is not yet out)

If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Building SuperTuxKart ==

As of 0.7.3, you may use either CMake or autotools to build SuperTuxKart.


=== CMake ===
 mkdir cmake_build
 cd cmake_build
 cmake ..
 make
 # optional
 sudo make install

this will install in /usr/local. If you want to install somewhere else, replace the "cmake" command with something like :

 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/stk

to make a debug build :

 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

and finally if irrlicht is not installed system-wide :

 cmake .. -DIRRLICHT_DIR=/full/path/to/irrlicht

Our CMake build system is younger so we welcome success/failure stories :)

=== Autotools ===

Simply use the usual autotools build triplet :

 ./configure
 make
 # optional
 sudo make install

(if you obtained the STK source code from SVN, you will first need to run <TT>./autogen.sh</TT>)

== Troubleshooting ==

Depending on whether your irrlicht build uses internal or external libpng/libjpeg dependencies, you may need to configure STK this way :

 ./configure LDFLAGS="-lpng -ljpeg -lbz2"
