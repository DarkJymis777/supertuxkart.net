This page collects information about the irrlicht port. Note that the irrlicht branch is _completely_ unstable, and we will most likely not be able to offer any support regarding bugs, how to compile, ... 

== Installing Irrlicht ==
[http://www.irrlicht3d.org/wiki/index.php?n=Main.InstallingIrrlicht Installing Irrlicht (Irrlicht Wiki)]
The build environment can use irrlicht either from an installed irrlicht package (as long as the header files are around), or directly from the irrlicht source tree. Configure should detect installation in default directories (/usr, /usr/local), if you are using an IDE, please adjust the appropriate entries.

The recommended version to use is irrlicht-1.7, since it uses many bug fixes for STK. It should also compile with version 1.6, though you might notice that some karts are nearly white, the speedometer is not shown correctly, and fonts are pixelated.

If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Getting the sources and compiling ==
The irrlicht version is now on the default trunk at:
 http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk

If you have been using the irrlicht branch switch to trunk by using:
 svn switch http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk .

To configure you have to use the option --with-irrlicht=/PATH/TO/IRRLICHT, unless you have irrlicht installed in system directories that are searched by the compiler automatically. Neither plib nor sdl are necessary anymore, though the other dependencies (openal, ogg, vorbis) still exist.

<small>sudo apt-get install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev</small>

== Running ==
Only a few tracks have been converted so far (beach, canyon, mines. jungle and lighthouse track). The GUI is mostly working, so you can race in those tracks any way you like. Still, the irrlicht version is currently in development, and we consider it only to be 'somewhat' playable.

== Exporting Tracks ==
A new [[track_exporter | track exporter]] is under development.
Some info about drivelines is found at [[new_drivelines]]

== Textures ==
To enable special graphical texture effects, those effects must be specified in an separate file. The format of this file is described [[materials_xml | here]].

== Converted Tracks ==
A [[converted_tracks | list of tracks]] that have been converted is available.
