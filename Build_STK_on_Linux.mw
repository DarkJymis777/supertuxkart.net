This page collects information about the irrlicht port.

== Installing Irrlicht ==
[http://www.irrlicht3d.org/wiki/index.php?n=Main.InstallingIrrlicht Installing Irrlicht (Irrlicht Wiki)]
The build environment can use irrlicht either from an installed irrlicht package (as long as the header files are around), or directly from the irrlicht source tree. Configure should detect installation in default directories (/usr, /usr/local), if you are using an IDE, please adjust the appropriate entries.

The recommended version to use is irrlicht-1.7.2, since it contains many bug fixes for STK.
If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Getting the sources and compiling ==
The irrlicht version is now on the default trunk at:
 http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk

If you have been using the irrlicht branch switch to trunk by using:
 svn switch http://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/trunk .

To configure you have to use the option --with-irrlicht=/PATH/TO/IRRLICHT, unless you have irrlicht installed in system directories that are searched by the compiler automatically. 

The other needed dependencies are : openal, ogg, vorbis. For ubuntu/debian :

 sudo apt-get install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev

Depending on whether your irrlicht build uses internal or external libpng/libjpeg dependencies, you may need to configure STK this way :

 ./configure LDFLAGS="-lpng -ljpeg -lbz2"
