== Installing dependencies ==

First of all, you will need a compiler and the autotools build system
 sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential

Other needed dependencies are : openal, ogg, vorbis. For ubuntu/debian :

 sudo apt-get install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev


== Installing Irrlicht ==
Start by installing irrlicht from your repositories if it is found there, otherwise check [http://www.irrlicht3d.org/wiki/index.php?n=Main.InstallingIrrlicht How to Install Irrlicht] from the irrlicht wiki.

Note that it's recommended to build irrlicht in release mode for full performance (default is debug mode)
<code>NDEBUG=1 make</code>

The build environment can use irrlicht either from an installed irrlicht package (e.g. in /usr/local), or directly from the irrlicht source tree. Configure should detect installation in default directories (/usr, /usr/local).

''If you leave irrlicht in its source tree and don't install it, you will need to configure STK with flag --with-irrlicht=/PATH/TO/IRRLICHT.''

SuperTuxKart 0.7 should be built using irrlicht 1.7.2, and SuperTuxKart 0.7.1 using irrlicht 1.8 (trunk at the time of this writing since 1.8 stable is not yet out)

If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Building SuperTuxKart ==

Simply use the usual autotools build triplet :

 ./configure
 make
 # optional
 sudo make install

(if you obtained the STK source code from SVN, you will first need to run <TT>./autogen.sh</TT>)


== Troubleshooting ==

Depending on whether your irrlicht build uses internal or external libpng/libjpeg dependencies, you may need to configure STK this way :

 ./configure LDFLAGS="-lpng -ljpeg -lbz2"
