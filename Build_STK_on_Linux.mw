This page collects information about the irrlicht port. Note that the irrlicht branch is _completely_ unstable, and we will most likely not be able to offer any support regarding bugs, how to compile, ... 

== Installing Irrlicht ==
For now the build environment assumes that irrlicht is used from the uninstalled irrlicht source directory.
<!--
You have to compile irrlicht yourself to enable SDL support in irrlicht. In the file .../include/IrrCompileConfig.h define the symbol _IRR_USE_SDL_DEVICE_  (the line is already in the file, but commented out) and then compile.
-->
If you have any problems with building irrlicht, please contact the irrlicht developers in their forum, since we most likely won't have the expertise to help with that.

== Getting the sources and compiling ==
The irrlicht branch is at https://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/branches/irrlicht. You can change from a current SVN repository to the irrlicht branch by using
 svn switch https://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/branches/irrlicht .
This will only download the new/changed files, and not the complete repository.

To configure you have to use the option --with-irrlicht=/PATH/TO/IRRLICHT (it should be the irrlicht root directory, i.e. in which include and lib directories are) and --enable-irrlicht. That should be all.

== Running ==
Only a few tracks have been converted so far (beach and lighthouse track), and many things still don't work properly. You might be able to start a race with the GUI by now (though afaik you will always start with a single kart in the beach track). You might want to use the command line options 
 -k 1 --track beach  --kart tux -N
(one kart, track beach (or use 'lighthouse'), use the kart tux and start the race immediately.

== Exporting Tracks ==
A new [[track_exporter | track exporter]] is under development.
